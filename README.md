**Generic Truss Bridge - NX Nastran**
- **__Status__**: :+1:
  - Analyze and check the answers obtained from the hand calculations by analyzing this truss in Nastran. 
  - Nastran uses an approximation technique called finite elements to solve problems. 
  - It does not use the same method as the hand calculations. 
  - The finite element method subdivides each member of the structure into a finite number of finite-sized elements.
